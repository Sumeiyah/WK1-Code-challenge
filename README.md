# JavaScript Programming Challenges

This repository contains JavaScript programs that solve various programming challenges.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Student Grade Calculator

The `student-grade-calculator.js` file calculates the grade based on the input marks of a student. The program prompts the user to input the student's marks between 0 and 100 and then outputs the corresponding grade.

### Challenge 2: Speed Detector

The `speed-detector.js` file determines if a car's speed exceeds the speed limit and calculates the demerit points for the driver. The program prompts the user to input the car's speed in km/h and then outputs the demerit points or "Ok" if the speed is within the limit.

### Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

The `net-salary-calculator.js` file calculates an individual's net salary based on the inputs of basic salary and benefits. The program calculates the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, NSSF deductions, gross salary, and net salary.
